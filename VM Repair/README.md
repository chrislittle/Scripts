This is script executes a VM repair for the recent CrowdStrike incident.  

**The current version has limited features and requires the user input the VM, RG, Subscription ID for a single VM**  
**This does not actually remove any of the CrowdStrike files as this is under development right now**

We are actively working on improvements to run in guest cleanup of CrowdStrike files, allow for bulk (csv) runs etc as of 7-19-24 12:34 PM EST
